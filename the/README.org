* The Heretic's Emacs Config
** Appearance
*** Basic Setup
This file has appearance tweaks that are unrelated to the color
theme. Menus, scroll bars, bells, cursors, and so on. See also
=the-theme=, which customizes the color theme specifically.

*** Fullscreen
I use =chunkwm= to manage most windows, including Emacs, so the native
fullscreen mode is unnecessary. It's also necessary to set pixelwise
frame resizing non-nil for a variety of window managers. I don't see
any particular harm in having it on, regardless of WM.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (the-with-operating-system macOS
    (setq ns-use-native-fullscreen nil))
  (setq frame-resize-pixelwise t)
#+END_SRC

*** Interface Cleanup
Emacs defaults are a nightmare of toolbars and scrollbars and such
nonsense. We'll turn all of that off.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (menu-bar-mode -1)
  (setq ring-bell-function #'ignore)
  (scroll-bar-mode -1)
  (tool-bar-mode -1)
  (blink-cursor-mode -1)
#+END_SRC

*** Keystroke Display
Display keystrokes in the echo area immediately, not after one
second. We can't set the delay to zero because somebody thought it
would be a good idea to have that value suppress keystroke display
entirely.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq echo-keystrokes 1e-6)
#+END_SRC

*** No Title Bars
I put a lot of effort into purging title bars from most of the
software I use on a regular basis (what a waste of real estate), and
in Emacs 26 (might really be 26.2 or so) this is built in. For earlier
versions, patches exist to get the same effect.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (if (version<= "26" emacs-version)
      (setq default-frame-alist '((undecorated . t))))
#+END_SRC

*** Fonts
I use Pragmata Pro everywhere, but I'll eventually figure out how to
deal with fonts properly and allow this to be specified.

*** Adjust font size by screen resolution
The biggest issue I have with multiple monitors is that the font size
is all over the place. The functions below just set up some reasonable
defaults and machinery to change the size depending on the resolution
of the monitor.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun the-fontify-frame (frame)
    (interactive)
    (the-with-windowed-emacs
      (if (> (x-display-pixel-width) 2000)
          (set-frame-parameter frame 'font "PragmataPro 22") ;; Cinema Display
        (set-frame-parameter frame 'font "PragmataPro 16"))))

  (defun the-fontify-this-frame ()
    (interactive)
    (the-fontify-frame nil))

  (defun the-fontify-idle ()
    (interactive)
    (the-fontify-this-frame)
    (run-with-idle-timer 1 t 'the-fontify-this-frame))

  (call-interactively 'the-fontify-idle)
#+END_SRC
** Auto-completion
*** Company
=company= provides an in-buffer autocompletion framework. It
allows for packages to define backends that supply completion
candidates, as well as optional documentation and source code. Then
Company allows for multiple frontends to display the candidates, such
as a tooltip menu. Company stands for "Complete Anything".

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defvar the-company-backends-global
    '(company-capf
      company-files
      (company-dabbrev-code company-keywords)
      company-dabbrev)
    "Values for `company-backends' used everywhere.
  If `company-backends' is overridden by The, then these
  backends will still be included.")
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package company
    :demand t
    :init (company-tng-configure-default)
    :config
    <<company-config>>
    :delight company-mode)
#+END_SRC


*** Company Settings
Now that all the bindings are out of the way, we do the following:
- Show completions instantly, rather than after half a second.
- Show completions after typing three characters.
- Show a maximum of 10 suggestions. This is the default but I think
  it's best to be explicit.
- Always display the entire suggestion list onscreen, placing it above
  the cursor if necessary.
- Always display suggestions in the tooltip, even if there is only
  one. Also, don't display metadata in the echo area (this conflicts
  with ElDoc).
- Show quick-reference numbers in the tooltip (select a completion
  with M-1 through M-0).
- Prevent non-matching input (which will dismiss the completions
  menu), but only if the user interacts explicitly with Company.
- Company appears to override our settings in =company-active-map=
  based on =company-auto-complete-chars=. Turning it off ensures we
  have full control.
- Prevent Company completions from being lowercased in the
  completion menu. This has only been observed to happen for
  comments and strings in Clojure. (Although in general it will
  happen wherever the Dabbrev backend is invoked.)
- Only search the current buffer to get suggestions for
  =company-dabbrev= (a backend that creates suggestions from text
  found in your buffers). This prevents Company from causing lag
  once you have a lot of buffers open.
- Make company-dabbrev case-sensitive. Case insensitivity seems
  like a great idea, but it turns out to look really bad when you
  have domain-specific words that have particular casing.

** Binding Keys

*** Custom Prefix
There's a lot of room for keybindings, but we rely on a common prefix
for discoverability and to leave room for extension. This also makes
creating modal bindings later quite a bit easier.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defcustom the-prefix "M-T"
    "Prefix key sequence for The-related keybindings.
  This is a string as would be passed to `kbd'."
    :group 'the
    :type 'string)
#+END_SRC

For convenience, we also have a function that will create binding
strings using our prefix. This mainly gets used in bind-key
declarations until I can figure out how to evaluate code in org-table
cells to make the whole thing more customizable.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun the-join-keys (&rest keys)
    "Join key sequences. Empty strings and nils are discarded.
  \(the--join-keys \"M-P e\" \"e i\") => \"M-P e e i\"
  \(the--join-keys \"M-P\" \"\" \"e i\") => \"M-P e i\""
    (string-join (remove "" (mapcar #'string-trim (remove nil keys))) " "))
#+END_SRC


*** =bind-key=
=bind-key= is the prettier cousin of =define-key= and
=global-set-key=, as well as providing the =:bind= family of keywords
in =use-package=,

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package bind-key)
#+END_SRC
** Syntax Checking
*** Flycheck
Flycheck provides a framework for in-buffer error and warning
highlighting, or more generally syntax checking. It comes with a large
number of checkers pre-defined, and other packages define more.

**** Settings

***** Enable Flycheck Globally
Enable Flycheck in all buffers, but also allow for disabling it
per-buffer.

#+NAME: flycheck-global
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (global-flycheck-mode +1)
  (put 'flycheck-mode 'safe-local-variable #'booleanp)
#+END_SRC

***** Disable Flycheck in the modeline
It's honestly more distracting than anything,

#+NAME: no-flycheck-modeline
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq flycheck-mode-line nil)
#+END_SRC

**** =use-package= declaration
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package flycheck
    :defer 3
    :config
    <<flycheck-global>>
    <<no-flycheck-modeline>>
    )
#+END_SRC
** Clipboard Integration
*** macOS integration
Like mouse integration, clipboard integration
works properly in windowed Emacs but not in terminal Emacs (at
least by default). This code was originally based on [[https://gist.github.com/the-kenny/267162][1]], and then
modified based on [[http://emacs.stackexchange.com/q/26471/12534][2]].

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (the-with-operating-system macOS
    (the-with-terminal-emacs
      (defvar the-clipboard-last-copy nil
        "The last text that was copied to the system clipboard.
  This is used to prevent duplicate entries in the kill ring.")

      (defun the-clipboard-paste ()
        "Return the contents of the macOS clipboard, as a string."
        (let* (;; Setting `default-directory' to a directory that is
               ;; sure to exist means that this code won't error out
               ;; when the directory for the current buffer does not
               ;; exist.
               (default-directory "/")
               ;; Command pbpaste returns the clipboard contents as a
               ;; string.
               (text (shell-command-to-string "pbpaste")))
          ;; If this function returns nil then the system clipboard is
          ;; ignored and the first element in the kill ring (which, if
          ;; the system clipboard has not been modified since the last
          ;; kill, will be the same). Including this `unless' clause
          ;; prevents you from getting the same text yanked the first
          ;; time you run `yank-pop'. (Of course, this is less relevant
          ;; due to `counsel-yank-pop', but still arguably the correct
          ;; behavior.)
          (unless (string= text the-clipboard-last-copy)
            text)))

      (defun the-clipboard-copy (text)
        "Set the contents of the macOS clipboard to given TEXT string."
        (let* (;; Setting `default-directory' to a directory that is
               ;; sure to exist means that this code won't error out
               ;; when the directory for the current buffer does not
               ;; exist.

               ;; Setting `process-connection-type' makes Emacs use a pipe to
               ;; communicate with pbcopy, rather than a pty (which is
               ;; overkill).
               (process-connection-type nil)
               ;; The nil argument tells Emacs to discard stdout and
               ;; stderr. Note, we aren't using `call-process' here
               ;; because we want this command to be asynchronous.
               ;;
               ;; Command pbcopy writes stdin to the clipboard until it
               ;; receives EOF.
               (proc (start-process "pbcopy" nil "pbcopy")))
          (process-send-string proc text)
          (process-send-eof proc))
        (setq the-clipboard-last-copy text))

      (setq interprogram-paste-function #'the-clipboard-paste)
      (setq interprogram-cut-function #'the-clipboard-copy)))
#+END_SRC

*** Inter-program paste
If you have something on the system clipboard, and then kill something
in Emacs, then by default whatever you had on the system clipboard is
gone and there is no way to get it back. Setting the following option
makes it so that when you kill something in Emacs, whatever was
previously on the system clipboard is pushed into the kill ring. This
way, you can paste it with =yank-pop=.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq save-interprogram-paste-before-kill t)
#+END_SRC
