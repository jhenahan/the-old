;; In recent versions of macOS, there is an annoying configuration
;; problem wherein TLS verification does not work out of the box,
;; since macOS does not provide certificates in a place that can be
;; read by `gnutls', or something silly like that. The user impact is
;; that anytime Emacs tries to make an HTTPS connection, the user is
;; presented with a warning saying that there was a verification
;; error. See [1] for further discussion of this issue, and for the
;; original source of the solution given below. In order to take
;; advantage of it, you must install the 'libressl' package from
;; Homebrew.
