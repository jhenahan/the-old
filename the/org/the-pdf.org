* PDF Functionality
** Requirements                                                   :noexport:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (require 'the-package)

** =pdf-tools=
DocView is the built-in PDF viewer in Emacs, but it's a bit meh.
=pdf-tools= is significantly nicer, with much better support for
in-document hyperlinks and fancy things like that. It does require
compilation of an external library, though.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package pdf-tools
    :init
    (pdf-tools-install)
    (setq pdf-view-midnight-colors '("#fe8019" . "#1d2021"))
    (add-hook 'pdf-view-mode-hook #'pdf-view-midnight-minor-mode))
#+end_src

** Provides                                                       :noexport:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (provide 'the-pdf)

  ;;; the-pdf.el ends here
#+end_src
