* Window System
These macros give us a convenient way to conditionally execute code
based on the active window system.

** Requirements                                                   :noexport:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-
  ;;; the-windowed.el --- Checking the window system
#+end_src

** Macros
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defmacro the-with-windowed-emacs (&rest body)
    "Eval BODY if Emacs is windowed, else return nil."
    (declare (indent defun))
    `(when (display-graphic-p)
       ,@body))

  (defmacro the-with-terminal-emacs (&rest body)
    "Eval BODY if Emacs is not windowed, else return nil."
    (declare (indent defun))
    `(unless (display-graphic-p)
       ,@body))
#+end_src

** Provides                                                       :noexport:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (provide 'the-windowed)

  ;;; the-windowed.el ends here
#+end_src
