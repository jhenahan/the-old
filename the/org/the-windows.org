* Window Management
Note to self: consider renaming this file in case you actually do some
windows specific magic later. :smile:

** Requirements                                                   :noexport:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-
  ;;; the-windows.el --- Managing windows
  (require 'the-package)
#+end_src

** Window Balancing
I'm a great fan of =golden-ratio=.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package golden-ratio
    :demand t
    :config
    (golden-ratio-mode t)
    :diminish "Ï†")
#+end_src

** Window Selection
By default, Emacs maintains focus in whatever window you're working
in, but usually what I intend it to pop a new window or split and
focus that immediately. With =shackle=, it's easy to set this up.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package shackle
    :demand t
    :config
    (setq shackle-rules '(
                          (compilation-mode :noselect t)
                          (magit-diff-mode :noselect t)
                          ("*Warnings*" :noselect t)
                          )
          shackle-default-rule '(:select t))
    (shackle-mode 1))
#+end_src
** Provides                                                       :noexport:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (provide 'the-windows)

  ;;; the-windows.el ends here
#+end_src
