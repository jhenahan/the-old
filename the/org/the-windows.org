* Window Management
Note to self: consider renaming this file in case you actually do some
windows specific magic later. :smile:

** Requirements                                                   :noexport:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;;; the-windows.el --- Managing windows
  (require 'the-package)
#+end_src

** Window Balancing
I used to be a great fan of =golden-ratio=, but it hasn't seen an
update in 2 years and =zoom= seems quite cool.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package zoom
    :demand t
    :config
    (zoom-mode t))
#+end_src

** Provides                                                       :noexport:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (provide 'the-windows)

  ;;; the-windows.el ends here
#+end_src
