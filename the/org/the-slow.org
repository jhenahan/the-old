* Performance Mode
Occasionally features like indentation and autocompletion are
expensive, so we set up a minor mode to slow them down.
** Requirements                                                   :noexport:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;;; the-slow.el --- For when Emacs just isn't fast enough
#+end_src

** Modes
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (define-minor-mode the-slow-indent-mode
    "Minor mode for when the indentation code is slow.
  This prevents `aggressive-indent' from indenting as frequently.")

  (define-minor-mode the-slow-autocomplete-mode
    "Minor mode for when the autocompletion code is slow.
  This prevents `company' and `eldoc' from displaying metadata as
  quickly.")
#+end_src

** Provides                                                       :noexport:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (provide 'the-slow)

  ;;; the-slow.el ends here
#+end_src
