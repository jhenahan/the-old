* Performance Mode
Occasionally features like indentation and autocompletion are
expensive, so we set up a minor mode to slow them down.
** Requirements                                                   :noexport:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-
  ;;; the-slow.el --- For when Emacs just isn't fast enough
#+end_src

** Aggressive Byte Compilation
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package auto-compile
    :init
    (setq auto-compile-display-buffer nil)
    (setq auto-compile-mode-line-counter t)
    (setq auto-compile-update-autoloads t)
    :config
    (auto-compile-on-load-mode)
    (auto-compile-on-save-mode))
#+end_src
** Modes
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (define-minor-mode the-slow-indent-mode
    "Minor mode for when the indentation code is slow.
  This prevents `aggressive-indent' from indenting as frequently.")

  (define-minor-mode the-slow-autocomplete-mode
    "Minor mode for when the autocompletion code is slow.
  This prevents `company' and `eldoc' from displaying metadata as
  quickly.")
#+end_src

** Provides                                                       :noexport:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (provide 'the-slow)

  ;;; the-slow.el ends here
#+end_src
