* Undo
** Requirements                                                   :noexport:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-
  ;;; the-undo.el -- Better undo interaction
  (require 'the-package)
#+end_src

** Undo Tree
Emacs undo is extremely powerful, but also extremely hard to grok.
Undo Tree allows us to visualize the changes we've made and step
through the tree.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package undo-tree
    :demand t
    :config
    (global-undo-tree-mode)
    :delight undo-tree-mode
    )
#+end_src

** Provides                                                       :noexport:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (provide 'the-undo)

  ;;; the-undo.el ends here
#+end_src
