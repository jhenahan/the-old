* Killing and Yanking (copying and pasting)
** Requirements                                                   :noexport:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-
  ;;; the-yank.el --- Killing and yanking
#+end_src

** Settings
*** Delete Selection
If you start typing when you have something selected, then the
selection will be deleted. If you press DEL while you have something
selected, it will be deleted rather than killed. (Otherwise, in both
cases the selection is deselected and the normal function of the key
is performed.)

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (delete-selection-mode 1)
#+end_src

**** AUCTeX compatibility
Make delete-selection-mode work properly with AUCTeX.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (with-eval-after-load 'latex
    (put 'LaTeX-insert-left-brace 'delete-selection t))
#+end_src
*** Eliminate duplicates in kill ring
If you kill the same thing twice, you won't have to use =yank= twice
to get past it to older entries in the kill ring.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq kill-do-not-save-duplicates t)
#+end_src
