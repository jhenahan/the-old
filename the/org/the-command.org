* Enable Disabled Commands
  It is obvious to anyone that if a function is disabled then it must
  be powerful, or at least interesting. I want them.

** Requirements                                                    :noexport:
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     ;;; the-command.el --- Enable disabled commands
   #+end_src

** Do it
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (setq disabled-command-function nil)
   #+end_src

** Provides                                                        :noexport:
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (provide 'the-command)

     ;;; the-command.el ends here
   #+end_src
