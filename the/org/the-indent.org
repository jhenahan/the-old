** Aggressive Indent
Assuming your indentation is consistent, this will keep it correct
without any additional work.
*** Setup
:PROPERTIES:
:header-args: :tangle no
:END:
**** Local Variable
Here, we set up =aggressive-indent-mode= as a variable we can set on a
file- or directory-local level.
#+NAME: agg-indent-local
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (put 'aggressive-indent-mode 'safe-local-variable #'booleanp)
#+end_src
**** Slow mode
We register =aggressive-indent= with our slow mode, allowing us to
disabled reindentation on save for situations in which reindentation
is expensive. Note that
=aggressive-indent--proccess-changed-list-and-indent= is not a
typo. Or rather, it is, but it's in the actual package, not on us.
#+NAME: agg-indent-slow
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun the-aggressive-indent-toggle-slow ()
    "Slow down `aggressive-indent' by disabling reindentation on save.
  This is done in `the-slow-indent-mode'."
