* Clipboard Integration
** Requirements :noexport:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-
  ;;; the-clipboard.el --- Integration with the system clipboard

  (require 'the-os)
  (require 'the-windowed)
#+end_src

** macOS integration
Like mouse integration, clipboard integration
works properly in windowed Emacs but not in terminal Emacs (at
least by default). This code was originally based on [[https://gist.github.com/the-kenny/267162][1]], and then
modified based on [[http://emacs.stackexchange.com/q/26471/12534][2]].

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (the-with-operating-system macOS
    (use-package osx-clipboard
      :demand t
      :diminish
      :config
      (osx-clipboard-mode +1)))
#+end_src

** Inter-program paste
If you have something on the system clipboard, and then kill something
in Emacs, then by default whatever you had on the system clipboard is
gone and there is no way to get it back. Setting the following option
makes it so that when you kill something in Emacs, whatever was
previously on the system clipboard is pushed into the kill ring. This
way, you can paste it with =yank-pop=.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq save-interprogram-paste-before-kill t)
#+end_src

** Provides :noexport:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (provide 'the-clipboard)

  ;;; the-clipboard.el ends here
#+end_src
