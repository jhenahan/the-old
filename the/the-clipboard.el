;;; the-clipboard.el --- Integration with the system clipboard

(require 'the-os)

;; Like mouse integration (see `the-mouse'), clipboard integration
;; works properly in windowed Emacs but not in terminal Emacs (at
;; least by default). This code was originally based on [1], and then
;; modified based on [2].
